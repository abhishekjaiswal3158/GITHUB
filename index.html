        <h2>VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM</h2>
        <p>
            Version control systems are a category of software tools that helps record changes to files by keeping a track of modifications done to the code. Version control enables multiple people to simultaneously work on a single project. Each person edits his
            or her own copy of the files and chooses when to share those changes with the rest of the team. Thus, temporary or partial edits by one person do not interfere with another person's work.

        <h2>What GIT is about?</h3>

            <p>Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Git relies on the basis of distributed development of a software where more than one
                developer may have access to the source code of a specific application and can modify changes to it which may be seen by other developers.. Initially designed and developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development in 2005. Every
                git working directory is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking capabilities, independent of network access or a central server. Git allows a team of people to work together, all using the same files.
                And it helps the team cope up with the confusion that tends to happen when multiple people are editing the same files.</p>
